Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Prevent linking qhelpconverter against static bearer
 plugins

This would lead to linker errors since Qt Network isn't used
by qhelpconverter and hence its dependencies aren't pulled.

FIXME:
* Find out why qmake attempts to link against plugins
  by default which are from a module which isn't even used.
* Fix pulling dependencies of static modules when only
  the plugin, but not the related module itself, is used.
